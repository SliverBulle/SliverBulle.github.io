Hello, everyone. 
I'm Lei Hu, a first year postgraduate student from [Computer Science and Engineering department](https://cse.ucsd.edu/), [University of California, San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/). My research interest includes Retrieval-augmented Generation,knowledge extraction,natural language processing, and machine learning.

You can find my CV here:[Lei Hu's Curriculum Vitae](../images/Lei_Hu_CV_1011.pdf)

======

I studied at [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/) and got my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology.

I worked on [Shiyanjia](https://www.shiyanjia.com/) as an AI engineer. At that time, I was responsible for the development of the company's AI products, an copilot for salesman, focusing on the application of RAG and knowledge graph in the field of material science and chemistry.

My area of particular fascination lies in the domain of Retrieval-augmented Generation, where I firmly believe there is ample room for innovation and enhancement beyond the current cutting-edge solutions.
1. The integration of Knowledge Graphs into RAG systems has shown promising results in enhancing query focus summaries and improving contextual accuracy. Examples such as Microsoft's GraphRAG and Nvidia's Hybrid RAG demonstrate the potential of this approach.

2. Recent advancements like memorag or autocoder.rag, which utilize memory models for retrieval, are particularly intriguing. These advancements can accommodate vast amounts of contextual information, effectively tackling complex Query-Focused Summarization (QFS) tasks.

The ever-evolving nature of this field, coupled with these innovative technologies, inspires me to contribute to pushing the boundaries of what is possible in the Retrieval-augmented Generation.

Currently, I am working on the application of Retrieval-augmented Generation auto-evaluation, please contact me if you are interested.
